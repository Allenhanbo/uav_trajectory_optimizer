Two videos of the trajectories generated by this solver are available here:

This is a highly efficient solver to generate trajectories for UAVs. It's basically a C++ wrapper for the C code generated by CVXGEN to solve the optimization problem to generate trajectories for UAVs. 

It includes three solvers to solve for:

* Velocity-Controlled Trajectories (state is position)
* Acceleration-Controlled Trajectories (states are position and velocity)
* Jerk-Controlled Trajectories (states are position, velocity and jerk)


### Instructions:
Clone this repository:
```
git clone...
```
Now compile the cvxgen code:
```
chmod +x setup.sh 
./setup.sh
```
Then compile the c++ wrapper:

```
catkin config -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
catkin build
```

And finally execute the example:
```
catkin config -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
catkin build
```
